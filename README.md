# ARMA_Model_PM2.5_Austin

####  In my project on air quality analysis in Austin, I followed a comprehensive approach, covering various steps:

Data Acquisition: I obtained the air quality data for Austin, which includes pollutants like PM2.5, 
from reliable sources https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html

Data Wrangling: I cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and any other data quality issues, 
ensuring the data's suitability for analysis and modeling.

Model Tuning: I selected appropriate time series models, such as ARIMA, or  and tuned their parameters to achieve the 
best possible performance. Parameter tuning was essential for improving the accuracy of my models.

Data Visualization: I created visualizations, including time series plots and correlograms, 
to gain insights into the patterns and trends in the air quality data. Visualizations helped convey insights effectively.

Resource-Performance Trade-off: I considered the trade-off between model complexity and performance. 
More complex models might provide better accuracy, but they may also require more computational resources and 
be harder to interpret.

Model Evaluation: I evaluated the performance of my models using appropriate metrics, 
such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Model evaluation helped me understand how well my models were capturing the air 
quality patterns.


Overall, my project demonstrated a thorough and systematic approach to analyzing air quality data using time series models. 
I covered critical aspects of the analysis, including data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. 
My insights can be valuable for understanding air quality trends in Austin and potentially for making informed predictions. 
I'm pleased with completing such a comprehensive project!
